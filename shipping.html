If the entirety of the order is not received and processed by our fulfilment center within 180 days since the order date, we will not issue your refund. In this event any goods received will not be returned to you.</p>
<p>B) Along with your returned order you must clearly include details regarding your order, including (1) Your <em>ClickBank Order ID</em> (found in your order receipt), (2) Your <em>Full Name</em>, (3) Your <em>Full Address</em> where the shipment was received, (4) Your <em>Email Address</em> and (5) your <em>Phone Number</em> so that a member of our fulfilment  center staff can clearly read and process your return. Contact our support team at <a href="mailto:contact@exipure.com">contact@exipure.com</a> if you need help retrieving this information.</p>
<p>Failure to fully meet both refund requirements A) and B) above will result in our inability to refund you. The customer must pay for the shipping to return the products to us. Once our fulfilment center has received your order and processed the information, you will be issued a refund. Your refund will be credited back to your bank account and may take up to 5-10 business days to show in your statement, depending on the speed of the processing bank.</p>

We will continue to refund the cost of the bottles you have ordered as per our policy above. For international orders you may be liable to pay customs charges and these would be non-refundable.</p>
